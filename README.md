# LSRP-Export-Extension
A browser extension to put customer id and item price in the csv exported by Light Speed Retail Pos, specifically for customer and item report.

There is barely any to no security risk that comes with using this extension, as you would have to be logged in to a Light Speed Retail Pos account to use the extension and all the extension does is automatically fetch data from webpages that a logged-in account would be able to access manually.
